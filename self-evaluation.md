# Arrays Self-Evaluation
- How confident do you feel with the content on arrays so far?
Fairly good, although now I'm realizing that I should probably be capitalizing Arrays whenever I'm referring to them like the materials have. My undergrad was in economics and we did a lot of work with matrices which seem fairly similar.

Sharie and I ended up doing our pairing exercise before completing the arrays work (accidentally), so we walked through a lot of it together and I enjoyed talking it through like that a lot.

- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I've been running through some of the mdn web docs' content on Arrays and I've been finding that really interesting/helpful. I'll dig into that later on once I've finished my deliverables.

- What questions do you have about Arrays?
I guess I'm just wondering what more complex arrays look like with many more values, but I might be getting ahead of myself there and I suspect something else might be used (e.g. other languages).
